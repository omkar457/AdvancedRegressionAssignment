# Austrilian housing case study
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

>The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
* How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- Required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. 
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
